# YelpCamp
 This is the first CRUD app I've ever built - Create and comment on campsites with authentication & authorization using a MongoDB

 This app allows users to create a campsite with a title, image, price, and description. 

 The app uses RESTful routing. 

 Each campsite can be viewed by anyone, but creating a campsite requires registering and being logged in.

 Campsites can be commented on by any registered and logged in user.

 Campsites and comments can only be edited or deleted by the author.
 
 The app features flash flags upon registering,  logging in, logging out, adding a post, adding a comment, or editing either.

 This was built as my final project of Colt Steel's "The Web Dev Bootcamp" hosted on Udemy"

 The app is hosted and running on Heroku with MongoDB Atlas, check it out here:
